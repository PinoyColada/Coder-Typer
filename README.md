### ***Description***
### A ___program___ by a ___programmer___, for ___programmers___.
#### I came up with this idea as I was new to Javascript at General Assembly and wanted to get more familiar with the syntax. I frequently go on https://play.typeracer.com/ to see how fast I could type. For those who do not know what a typeracer game contains, you simply go against other people around the world and try to type the provided quote as fast as possible under a given amount of time to win. I thought to myself, "Hey, instead of typing quotes from movies or books, why not use lines of code instead to help me in my software engineering journey?".
#### That's where Coder Typer comes in. You are provided a box for you to type in and another box full of code. Your main objective of the game is to type the code given too you. Sounds easy right? Wrong. You will be given a timer and must finish under that time limit. At the end of each game, you will be shown the results of the game such as your accuracy, how many words per minute you typed, how many words you typed wrong, and additionally what the code you just typed meant and a link to it. You are not also becoming a better typer, but getting more familar with Javascript syntax!
#### ***For those who are "slow as a turtle" typers and new to programming:*** You will explore various structures of coding that you will learn on your journey in becoming a fully established programmer and at the same time test your typing speed. It's a win-win!
#### ***For those developers who want to increase their WPM:*** Maybe you're already a professional at coding and want to amp up your typing speed. This game will fix that problem for you.
#### ***For those fast typers who are just getting into programming:*** Maybe you're the fastest typer in your neighborhood and have this billion dollar app idea in mind. This game will help you be aware of the coding structures you will see while learning how to code.
#### ***For both experienced and fast-typing developers:*** Congrats! You reached the ultimate purpose of this game! You may ask to youself "Why should you play this game? You are already a professional in both fields." Some reasons are that you'll be open to syntax you haven't used that much before and may use on future projects or maybe just need a refresher on Javascript after a long vacation from your software engineer job!
